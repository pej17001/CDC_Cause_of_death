Before the 2000s, due to the lack of productivity and low level of hygiene, a significant amount of people died from plagues and infections. When antibiotics, such as penicillin, were found in the 2000 century, the fatality rate of plague and infections decreased dramatically. Because of the rapid development of modern medicine, more and more threatening diseases can now be cured. However, every coin has two sides. Technological development and the excess capacity of industry in modern society lead to a lot of new problems such as drug abuse and obesity. We are interested in doing research and analysis on the causes of death in the past ten years to see whether huge changes are occurring and remind the public that we need to pay more attention to the prevention of new deadly diseases. Questions: What are the top 5 causes of death in our mortality dataset and what is top 5 states that have most deaths of these causes? What are the growth rates for these 5 causes of deaths for different identity groups in New York State for the previous 10 years? What is the top 5 cause of death and what is the spread of this disease in the U.S by state in 2020? What is the relationship between (locations, race, gender, age) and top 1 causes of death? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Both of us, Peilin Jing and Jing Wang, are responsible for collecting data, since our problems need different filters on CDC website. Data source URL: https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html The Underlying Cause of Death data available on WONDER are county-level national mortality and population data spanning the years 1999-2020. Data are based on death certificates for U.S. residents. Each death certificate identifies a single underlying cause of death and demographic data. The number of deaths, crude death rates or age-adjusted death rates, and 95% confidence intervals and standard errors for death rates can be obtained by place of residence (total U.S., region, state and county), age group (single-year-of age, 5-year age groups, 10-year age groups and infant age groups), race, Hispanic ethnicity, gender, year, cause-of-death (4-digit ICD-10 code or group of codes), injury intent and injury mechanism, drug/alcohol induced causes and urbanization categories. Data are also available for place of death, month and week day of death, and whether an autopsy was performed. Variables: Location: HHS Regions, Census Regions, Census Divisions, State, County. This is a categorical variable. Age Groups: 10 year age groups, 5 year age groups, single-year age groups and infant age groups. This is a categorical variable. Race: American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian / Pacific Islander, Black or African American, White. This is a categorical variable. Hispanic Origin: Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino, Not stated. This is a categorical variable. Gender (Sex): Female, Male. This is a binary categorical variable. Year of death: 1999-2020. This is a continuous numerical variable. Month of death: January through December. This is a categorical variable. Weekday of death: Sunday through Saturday, Unknown. This is a categorical variable. Autopsy performed: No, Yes, Unknown. This is a binary variable. Place of Death: Medical Facility - Inpatient, Medical Facility - Outpatient or ER, Medical Facility - Dead on Arrival, Medical Facility - Status Unknown (years 1999-2002 only), Decedent’s home, Hospice Facility (years 2003 and later only), Nursing home/long term care, Other, Place of death unknown. This is a categorical variable. Cause of Death: underlying cause of death - ICD-10 codes, Drug/Alcohol Induced Causes, Injury Intent and Mechanism groups, 113 Selected Causes, 130 Selected Causes (for infants), 15 Leading Causes. This is a categorical variable. Urbanization: classifies population density and other factors at the county level - pick between the 2006 or the 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. This is a categorical variable. For the additional variables we have, including deaths, population and crude rate, they are all continuous numerical variables. The length of the variables depends the filters we input on the CDC website, generally the totally number of data point is above 100,000. The data do have some problems, such as age group not stated, populations not applicable, and crude rate not reliable. However, we remove the data that is not stated or not applicable, and recalculated the crude rate using deaths and population variables.

The top five diseases that lead to death are “COVID-19”, “Atherosclerotic heart disease”, “Bronchus or lung, unspecified - Malignant neoplasms”, “Alzheimer disease, unspecified”, “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified”. The top five states that have the most death are California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania. The top five diseases that lead to the highest death rate are “COVID-19”, “Atherosclerotic heart disease”, “Bronchus or lung, unspecified - Malignant neoplasms”, and “Alzheimer disease, unspecified”, “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified”, which is the same as previous. The top five states that have the most death in West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. 5.2 Question 2: What are the growth rates for these 5 causes of deaths for different identity groups in New York State for the previous 10 years? 5.2.1 Female top 5 causes of death trend For female, the top 5 causes of death are \" Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified“,”Atherosclerotic heart disease“,”Bronchus or lung, unspecified - Malignant neoplasms“,”Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified “, and”Unspecified dementia\". 5.2.2 Male top 5 causes of death trend For male, the top 5 causes of deaths are “Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified”, “Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, so described”, “Atherosclerotic heart disease”, “Bronchus or lung, unspecified - Malignant neoplasms”, and “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified”. For both male and female, Atherosclerotic heart disease is the top one cause of death. For female, unspecified dementia was in an increasing trend in the past 10 years. For male, “Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, so described” was increasing drastically in year 2019 and 2020. Also, although death rate of “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified M” is not as high as other top 4 causes of death, this still has above 20 per 100,000 of death rate, which all the human beings need to be careful about this disease. 5.3 Question 3: What is the top 5 cause of death and what is the spread of this disease in the U.S by state in 2020? The highest death and highest death rate is different. 5.4 Question 4: What is the relationship between (locations, race, gender, age) and top 1 causes of death? 5.4.1 Find the top 1 cause of death: Atherosclerotic heart disease We found that Atherosclerotic heart disease is the top 1 cause of death in U.S for previous 10 years from 2011-2020, which crude rate is always above 50. 5.4.2 Create Mosaic Plot From the mosaic plot above, we have several findings. First, Male tend to have a higher risk of this disease. Second, young people are less like to die because of this disease. Third, there is not much difference between census regions. Last, Black or African American and White are riskier for this disease. For Race variable, “AIOAN” is American Indian or Alaska Native, “AOPI” is Asian or Pacific Islander , “BOAA” is Black or African American. 5.4.3 Build the decision tree based on previous finding ## ## High Low Medium ## 0.1322751 0.5185185 0.3492063 From the decision plot above, each node (little rectangle with color) shows the predicted class, the predicted probability of each class, and the percentage of observations in the node. This decision tree results in the same results we got in the mosaic plots, in which male, Black or African American and White, and old people are riskier. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Time series interactive plot (Q2)", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Time series interactive plot (Q2) 6.1.1 Female 6.1.2 Male Since our “Year” variable only has year instead of month, the pointed value would be “May XXXX”. From the interactive plot, we are more possible to know the crude death rate for each year and look at the pattern for the part we want. For example, if we want to see the trend pattern and the crude rate from the year 2011 to 2014, compared to the traditional time series plot, the interactive time series plot can give us exactly what we want by pointing to the plot and moving the bar below the plot. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Question 1 and 3 7.2 Question 2 and 4 7.3 Conclusion for the project", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Question 1 and 3 In the year of 2020, we found that the top 5 main reasons that cost most death is “COVID-19”, “Atherosclerotic heart disease”, “Bronchus or lung, unspecified - Malignant neoplasms”, “Alzheimer disease, unspecified”, and “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified”. And this five disease takes up 6% of total death. And among this five causes, the death caused by covid-19 is tiwce as much as other four. For the situation of each state, the top five state that have most death is California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvanina. And the top five state that have highest death rate is West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama, Ohio, Pennsylvanina. This is because the population of each state varies. 7.2 Question 2 and 4 For question 2, we use time series plot to show the trend of top 5 disease, excluding COVID-19, in recent 10 years for both gender. From the result, we would say people should care more about the “Atherosclerotic heart disease” and “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified M” diseases. For question 4, we used mosaic plot and decision tree plot to analyze the top 1 cause of death –“Atherosclerotic heart disease”. Our two plots shows the same result that male, Black or African American and White, and old people are more risky in this disease. 7.3 Conclusion for the project Our limitation here would be that we cannot download all the data using the filters as many as we want on the CDC website. This limitation results in the change of our questions, which we used to analyze on the top 10 causes of death for the previous 10 years. However, this limitation does not limit our ability to integrate and analyze data. For the alternative solution, we download the data using the same filters but different criteria and combine two datasets to get what we want for that question. we think this would be the lesson we learned from this project – how to get integrated data. In the future, we would be emphasis on the data collection and data cleaning processes, since we know how important would a meaningful and cleaning dataset be to our plots.
